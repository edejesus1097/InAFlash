EC327 group project. App based around quizzing yourself with flashcards.


To run, simply download and open in Android Studio.

It will take a while to build, but should work perfectly fine. We tested downloading on to Mac and Windows and it worked fine both times.


From there you can hit run inside of Android Studio.

Then you go through the app by creating a subject, then going back, selecting the study button, create a deck for that subject and then go back and study where you can actually flip through the cards.
